Machine learning is used to predict the optimal expression levels of genes in the ergothioneine metabolic pathway, thereby achieving an increase in yield. By integrating prior knowledge and applying advanced feature engineering, enzyme and cofactor ratios, identification of rate-limiting steps, metabolic burden characteristics, and pathway balance indices were utilized. This is a complete prediction framework, providing a reference for machine learning in metabolic engineering.
